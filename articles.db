NEW YORK - A young computer whiz from New York City has launched a site to help people buy cheap plane tickets. But an airline company and its travel partner want to shut him down. United Airlines and Orbitz filed a civil lawsuit last month against 22-year-old Aktarer Zaman, who founded the website Skiplagged.com last year. The site helps travelers find cheap flights by using a strategy called "hidden city" ticketing. The idea is that you buy an airline ticket that has a layover at your actual destination. Say you want to fly from New York to San Francisco -- you actually book a flight from New York to Lake Tahoe with a layover in San Francisco and get off there, without bothering to take the last leg of the flight. This travel strategy only works if you book a one-way flight with no checked bags (they would have landed in Lake Tahoe). It\'s not like these tickets are the cheapest all the time, but they often are. In the lawsuit, United and Orbitz call Skiplagged "unfair competition" and allege that it is promoting "strictly prohibited" travel. They want to recoup $75,000 in lost revenue from Zaman. Zaman said he knew a lawsuit was inevitable but he points out that there\'s nothing illegal about his web site. He also said he has made no profit via the website and that all he\'s done is help travelers get the best prices by exposing an "inefficiency," in airline prices that insiders have known about for decades. "[Hidden city ticketing] have been around for a while, it just hasn\'t been very accessible to consumers," Zaman told CNNMoney. Indeed, "hidden city," ticketing is no secret among frequent fliers, said Michael Boyd, President of Boyd Group International, an aviation consulting firm in Evergreen, Co. Boyd worked as an American Airline ticket agent 30 years ago, and says he was trained at the airline to help customers find "hidden city" fares. "I don\'t think it\'s illegal what he\'s doing," Boyd said. But lawsuits are expensive and it could end up costing the young entrepreneur who has irked the two billion dollar corporations. Airlines usually offer cheaper fares for some destinations that are not regional hubs, Boyd said. Many of these flights are routed through more popular destinations. But if a lot of people take advantage of that discrepancy it could hurt the airlines, which is why they want to shut him down. Born in Bangladesh, Zaman grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and graduated with a bachelor\'s degree in computer science at age 20 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He lives in Manhattan and works at a technology start-up that he declined to name. Zaman said Skiplagged is just a "side project." Zaman and United declined to discuss the lawsuit. Orbitz said in a statement that it is obligated to uphold airline fare rules. Other travel experts say that the airlines may not achieve much if Zaman\'s site is shut down, especially in a world where information is becoming more readily available. "If [Skiplagged is] shut down, undoubtedly there will be other people to come along to scrape fares and make them available," Robert Mann said, president of R.W. Mann & Company, an airline consulting firm in Port Washington, New York.'

S'A Horizon Air passenger plane crashed on an island in Puget Sound Friday night, not long after a suspect conducted an "unauthorized take-off" from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in Washington state, officials said. Witnesses reported seeing a large plume of smoke in the air above Ketron Island after the plane went down. No passengers were believed to be aboard the Q400 aircraft, airport officials said. No one on the sparsely inhabited island was believed to have been injured, the Pierce County Sheriff\'s Department said on Twitter. The unidentified pilot was a 29-year-old "suicidal male," the sheriff\'s department said. The Seattle Times reported that he was a Horizon Air employee from Sumner, Wash. The drama played out in real time on the Internet as the public was able to hear the suspect communicating with air traffic controllers via the air traffic control scanner. "I\'ve got a lot of people that care about me. It\'s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess," the suspect said, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . "I\'ve got a lot of people that care about me. It\'s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess." -- Voice on air control scanner, believed to be that of suspect In another instance, the suspect joked whether the airline would hire him as a pilot if he landed the plane safely. Pierce County Sheriff Paul Pastor said the man "did something foolish and may well have paid with his life." The sheriff\'s department said it was launching a background investigation on the suspect. The man, who was addressed as "Rich" in audio recordings with air traffic controllers, said he didn\'t want to land at a nearby military base because, "Those guys will rough me up if I try and land there." The crash of the Q400 -- described as a 76-seat aircraft designed for short trips -- occurred because the pilot was "doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills," the sheriff\'s department said. Horizon is a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines. Airport officials said that operations at the airport had resumed after being temporarily halted. Some unconfirmed reports on social media said the suspect was believed to have been an airline mechanic. Alaska Airlines later said he was an employee who helped direct aircraft to gates and de-ice planes. Around 9:15 p.m. PDT, Alaska Airlines tweeted: "We are aware of an incident involving an unauthorized take-off of a Horizon Air Q400. We believe there are no passengers on board. More information as we learn more." The Federal Aviation Administration issued a message soon after the take-off: "We can\'t confirm anything at this time. We\'re trying to get accurate information about what is actually going on. Without confirming anything, a stolen aircraft would be a security issue." Authorities said there was no connection to terrorism. A spokesman for the Pierce County Sheriff\'s Department said F-15 aircraft scambled out of Portland, Ore., and were in the air "within a few minutes" in order to keep "people on the ground safe." NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) issued a statement about the role of the military jets. "The stolen aircraft initially tracked south from Seattle-Tacoma. NORAD fighters were working to redirect the aircraft out over the Pacific Ocean when it crashed on the Southern tip of Ketron Island in the Southern end of Puget Sound. NORAD fighters did not fire upon the aircraft. The event was subsequently passed to local rescue and law enforcement," the statement read. According to Alaska Airlines, the aircraft was stolen about 8 p.m. Alaska Airlines said it was in a "maintenance position" and not scheduled for a passenger flight. Air travelers and residents able to see the plane in flight were quick to post messages on social media. "Apparently someone stole a plane from SeaTac?" wrote one Twitter user. "Saw two fighter jets fly overhead then smoke." "Some dude stole a plane from #Seatac (Allegedly), did a loop-the-loop, ALMOST crashed into #ChambersBay, then crossed in front of our party, chased by fighter jets and subsequently crashed.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Saturday morning that President Donald Trump is "monitoring the situation." He\'s currently at his New Jersey golf club. "Our hearts are with the family of the individual aboard as well as all our Alaska Air and Horizon Air employees," Constance von Muehlen, chief operating officer of Alaska Airlines, said in a recorded video statement. "We will provide more information as it becomes available." Washington Gov. Jay Inslee lauded the authorities\' response to the situation.

S'Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Dec. 4, 2018, 3:44 PM GMT A woman in Chicago is suing Hilton Worldwide for $100 million after she said an employee at an Albany, New York, hotel filmed her naked in the shower, posted the video online and tried to blackmail her. The woman, who is not named in the suit, alleges that the video was secretly recorded inside her room at the Hampton Inn and Suites in July 2015. She said she wasn\'t made aware that it existed until a few months ago when an email address she did not recognize sent her a link to a pornographic website where her video had been uploaded. The title of the video was her full name, according to the suit. That same day in September, the woman said she received another email from the same unidentified sender with the name of the university she attended and where she worked. The suspect also told the woman they knew she had been staying in New York to take the bar exam. According to the suit, filed Nov. 30, one of the emails read: "I\'m a perv. I don\'t hurt anyone. I like to watch. No need to worry about me. I just like to watch and then I move on to the next." Another email asked the woman to send a video. "Promise me my own show. That\'s the hottest. No need to show your face," it read, according to the lawsuit. "Then I disappear and remove the videos forever before they get copied on every website." When she refused to send the video, she claimed the suspect sent another email in October telling her to "reply before it\'s too late to stop it" from being further distributed. The suspect also allegedly demanded the woman pay $2,000 then another $1,000 a month for the next year, the lawsuit stated. When she did not pay, she said the alleged blackmailer emailed the video to her co-workers and posted it on at least a dozen X-rated websites. Her lawyer, Roland Christiansen, said he knows of at least one other video secretly recorded of another guest who stayed in the same room as his client. Christiansen also said in the suit that because of the amount of personal information the alleged extortionist has, they "would have to be an employee of the hotel or someone with direct access to the rooms." "It\'s been very difficult," he told NBC News in a phone call. "It affected her down to the deepest level because her friends and colleagues have seen this video of her." A spokesperson for the hotel said in a statement they are "shocked and stunned by the allegations." "The safety and security of our guests is our highest priority, and we emphatically do not condone any form of this type of invasion of privacy," the spokesperson said. "Thus far, no evidence of any kind has been found during our initial review of the situation. Recently, the hotel underwent a complete renovation. During that process, no recording devices of any kind were uncovered." The hotel said it will continue to work with the authorities regarding the alleged incident. The woman named Hilton Worldwide and its franchise partners in the suit, saying the ordeal caused her emotional distress. She\'s seeking $100 million in damages.

S'KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images Japan is notorious for its long working hours, which have been blamed for a national health crisis known as "karoshi" -- death from overwork. Panasonic hopes to curb this, instructing its 100,000-ish employees to work no later than 8 p.m. each day, reports Asahi Shimbun . This hour reduction still enables a 55-hour working week, but the directive from Panasonic President Kazuhiro Tsuga also limited overtime to 80 hours a month. The company isn\'t the first to encourage a better work-life balance for its employees. There\'s an initiative throughout Japan called Premium Friday, which encourages firms to let staff out of the office around 3 p.m. on the last Friday of each month. Over in the US, Amazon last year tested a 30-hour work week after a New York Times report that depicted it as a "challenging, even merciless place to work."'

S'An investigation is "focused on what appears to be the practice of substituting contaminants and fillers in the place of authentic product." The New York Attorney General has ordered WalMart ( WMT ) , GNC ( GNC ) , Target ( TGT ) and Walgreens ( WBA ) to stop selling certain herbal supplements that it says don\'t contain the herbal ingredient on the label, or contain only a small amount of it. The demands came in cease and desist letters addressed to company executives that were dated Monday. The New York Times first reported the letters . The letters included statements like: "No St. John\'s Wort DNA was identified." "No plant genetic material of any sort was identified in the product labeled Echinacea." And some contained allergens like wheat that were not properly labeled. The tests were performed on samples of gingko biloba, St. John\'s Wort, ginseng, garlic, echinacea and saw palmetto supplements bought from stores in New York. Purchases were made from several stores and samples from each bottle were tested multiple times, according to the attorney general. The cease and desist order applies only to specific lots of the supplements. But the letters also requested information about the manufacturers and testing procedures to support its "ongoing investigation of this matter." That investigation is "focused on what appears to be the practice of substituting contaminants and fillers in the place of authentic product," the attorney general\'s office said. Related: Hedge fund manager cries over Herbalife "It is our expectation that all suppliers conduct their business and produce products that are in full compliance with the law," WalMart spokesman Brian Nick said. "Based on this notice, we are immediately reaching out to the suppliers of these products to learn more information and will take appropriate action." Target said it had not yet seen the full report but "is committed to providing high quality and safe products to our guests." GNC disputed the accuracy of the testing process but said it would comply with the attorney general\'s order to remove the products from New York shelves. "We stand behind the quality, purity and potency of all ingredients listed on the labels of our private label products," said Laura Brophy, a spokeswoman for GNC. "GNC tests all of its products using validated and widely used testing methods." Walgreens said it is removing the products from its shelves and takes the matter "very seriously." Regulators have long cast a skeptical eye towards herbal supplements, questioning the benefits they promise, but they\'re subject to much less scrutiny than prescription and over-the-counter drugs.

S'Updated / Thursday, 6 Dec 2018 07:42 An Irish teacher has been killed in a stabbing incident at a university in the Paris suburbs. The 66-year-old was stabbed repeatedly in front of the private Pole Universitaire Leonard de Vinci in Courbevoie, northwest of Paris. A police source said that the suspect was a former student at the university who was born in Pakistan in 1981. "It\'s a tragedy that has struck the whole community. This was a language teacher who had been here for 20 years and was respected by everyone," the university\'s director Pascal Brouaye told reporters. A source close to the investigation said the teacher was stabbed 13 times, including in the throat. He was pronounced dead at 12.35pm, and a knife was found at the scene. The suspect was arrested after the incident. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told RTE News that it was aware of the case and was providing consular assistance. Sebastien Tran, director of the management school where the suspect had enrolled in 2016, said he had been kicked out in August 2017 for failing the year. Forensic police could be seen in front of the university in the early afternoon, where a white tent stood over the scene of the killing. "It\'s heartbreaking. We still can\'t believe it," said Stephen Amoah, a 28-year-old student from Ghana. His classmate Jad Sharif, a 33-year-old from Lebanon, described the murdered teacher as "very kind". "We liked him more than most of our teachers," he added. Students showed photographs of the teacher on their mobile phones, smiling and arm in arm with members of his class. French minister for higher education Frederique Vida paid tribute to the professor on Twitter and said an investigation was under way. She expressed "deep shock" and offered her condolences to the staff and students at the university, as well as the family and loved ones of the victim. Counselling services have been made available at the college for those traumatised by the incident. Additional reporting: AFP'

S'By Alan Mozes September 13, 2018 / 1:06 PM / HealthDay Americans continue to fatten up, with obesity rates topping 35 percent in seven states, a new report reveals. That\'s up from five states two years ago. Moreover, no state had a notable improvement in its obesity rate over the previous year, according to the report from Trust for America\'s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, both nonprofit health policy organizations. " Obesity is a complex and often intractable problem, and America\'s obesity epidemic continues to have serious health and cost consequences for individuals, their families and our nation," said John Auerbach, president of Trust for America\'s Health. "The good news is that there is growing evidence that certain prevention programs can reverse these trends. But we won\'t see meaningful declines in state and national obesity rates until they are implemented throughout the nation and receive sustained support," Auerbach said in a news release from his organization. States with obesity rates of 35 percent or more now include Iowa and Oklahoma. The others are Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia. The findings are based on 2017 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They represent a troubling trend, given that in 2012 no state had an obesity rate of 35 percent or more. Now in every state, at least 1 in 5 adults is obese, according to the "State of Obesity" report. How fat is your state? 52 photos Obesity\'s economic toll is monumental, the authors said.

Obesity\'s impact is most serious in communities where access to healthy foods and regular physical activity is limited. These are typically lower income and rural areas, including many communities of color, the report noted. West Virginia tops the obesity wall of shame. More than 38 percent of adults there have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more. Colorado has the lowest adult obesity rate in the nation, at just 22.6 percent. Overall, 22 states had adult obesity rates between 30 and 35 percent, while obesity was a health concern for at least one-quarter of adult residents across 19 states, the report said. U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data indicate that white obesity rates hover around 38 percent, compared with about 47 percent among blacks and Hispanics. The report offered recommendations for government policymakers, restaurant and food industries, and the health care system. Among them: States should mandate at least 60 minutes of physical education or activity during each school day. Medicare should promote and cover obesity counseling. Also, hospitals should stop selling or serving sugary drinks . First published on September 13, 2018 / 1:06 PM (c) 2018 HealthDay. All rights reserved.

S'This weekend is the 16th year the Remote Area Medical Team will be in Wise County Virginia providing free dental, medical, and vision care to people. And it\'s the first time a drone will deliver medicine to the site. It\'s a real world test of how drones could deliver medical help to people in remote areas. Jon Greene is acting associate director of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership at Virginia Tech. He says when it comes to UAS, Unmanned Aircraft Systems commonly known as drones, the main concern is safety for people on the ground. "What will happen is, assuming the weather cooperates on July 17th, in the morning, an SR22 from NASA Langley, and an SR22 is basically a general aircraft that has been fitted with an autonomy package that allows it to fly as an unmanned aircraft system or drone,. so there will be a pilot in the vehicle for safety purposes, but it will fly just like a UAS and it will take off from Tazewell, Virginia with prescriptions for about 20 patients and fly that medicine to Lonesome Pine airport in Wise, Virginia.

S'Smog more toxic than can be measured by monitoring devices has blanketed the Indian capital this week, months before the start of Delhi\'s traditional "pollution season". A thick haze was visible across the city from Tuesday and some government pollution monitors have recorded concentrations of 999 - the highest they can measure - as dust storms kicked up in nearby Rajasthan state blanketed the region. Though the billowing clouds of dust and sand were blamed for the immediate spike in pollution levels, the sight of dense smog engulfing Delhi months before winter has underscored a growing awareness that harmful air is a year-round problem for the city. NGEL (@nexgenearth) river of dust, high atmospheric aerosol loading, and hazardous air quality over N.I. subcontinent, as seen today by @nasa satellites and forecast at https://t.co/wBpx9GB1Cn - data from @NASAEarthData #worldview @airqualityindia @PakAirQuality @Open_AQ @jksmith34 @CBhattacharji pic.twitter.com/KnE25oTBJs June 14, 2018 Air quality in Delhi usually begins to plummet in October when slower winds and cooler temperatures trap pollutants closer to the ground. But data published by the government\'s Central Pollution Control Board shows that air quality has been classed "very unhealthy" - with index scores as high as 270 - every April and May for the past three years, or since authorities began collecting and publishing the statistics. Just a single day in April or May of the past three years had air classified as "good" - 12 April this year, when levels fell to 99. "It clearly shows that this is also a summertime problem," said Aishwarya Sudhir, an independent researcher who studies air quality in India . Authorities have ordered a halt to all construction in the capital and its satellite cities until the weekend to reduce pollution levels, and doctors have advised people to stay indoors as much as possible. Meteorologists said the presence of a layer of dust across the city is also trapping heat, sending temperatures soaring in excess of 40C. Concern about north India\'s air quality crisis is usually most acute after the Hindu festival of Diwali in autumn, when hundreds of thousands of Indians release firecrackers that combine with existing pollutants to form a poisonous haze over the region that persists for months until temperatures cool. Public health experts said pollution levels on some days in November last year were the equivalent of smoking 50 cigarettes per day. India, home to 14 of the world\'s top 20 most polluted cities, has the highest rate of respiratory diseases of any country. A leading lung specialist, Arvind Kumar, says the cancer patients he sees Delhi are younger, more often female and more likely to be non smokers than those outside the city. Children are the most vulnerable: a 2015 study concluded about half Delhi\'s 4.4m schoolchildren had stunted lung development and would never completely recover. But pressure on local and central governments to act usually clears along with the air in February when warmer temperatures help to thin the smog. Sudhir said this week\'s spike in pollution was a wake-up call that Delhi\'s air is rarely safe. "Polluting activities keep going on in the city during summer, including construction, allowing road dust to linger, the operation of coal-fired power plants and other things," she said. Under an action plan in place since January 2017, pollution levels of the kind recorded this week should have resulted in trucks being denied entry into the city, the closure of brick kilns and other polluting industries, and a ban on using diesel generators. Yet the government seems only to implement some of these measures, and only in response to public outcry, she said. "We tend to act only when it\'s an emergency," she said. "There were forecasts that dust storms would sweep the entire region. They should have acted on these weeks ago, not when it became this severe."'

S'Image Passengers waited in a security line at John F. Kennedy Airport last month in New York. Credit Credit Spencer Platt/Getty Images The Transportation Security Administration said on Tuesday that it would allow airplane passengers to bring pocketknives, golf clubs and other sports items aboard in carry-on bags, loosening some of the restrictions created after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The agency said the new rules , which align with international standards, would allow its security agents to "better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as explosives." Box cutters and razor blades are still prohibited in carry-on bags. Passengers will be permitted to carry pocketknives with blades shorter than 2.36 inches long and 0.5 inches wide. Knives with a locking or fixed blade, or those with a molded grip, will still be prohibited. The new rules will also allow passengers to bring on board previously banned sports equipment like lacrosse and hockey sticks, pool cues and ski poles, as well as no more than two golf clubs. Novelty and toy baseball bats measuring less than 24 inches, or weighing less than 24 ounces, will be permitted as well. The new policy was announced by John S. Pistole, the agency\'s administrator, at an international aviation safety conference held in Brooklyn. Mr. Pistole has sought to move the T.S.A. from a one-size-fits-all model to a more tailored approach that focuses on threats and risks. The agency introduced new programs, for instance, that allow some frequent fliers to go through special safety lines at designated airports if they have been cleared in advance. The changes, however, attracted sharp criticism from flight attendant unions. The Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents five labor groups and 90,000 people, said the decision was "poor and shortsighted." Stacy K. Martin, president of the Southwest Airlines flight attendants\' union, Transport Workers Union Local 556, said that while a small knife posed little threat to pilots locked in the cockpit, the new policy created unnecessary risks for cabin crew. "This policy was designed to make the lives of T.S.A. staff easier, but not make flights safer," she said in a statement. The new rules take effect April 25.

S'The Federal Communications Commission is to take a more active role in regulating the Internet as a public utility, which is expected to provoke court cases from major broadband providers. Credit Credit The New York Times WASHINGTON -- High-speed internet service can be defined as a utility, a federal court has ruled in a sweeping decision clearing the way for more rigorous policing of broadband providers and greater protections for web users. The decision affirmed the government\'s view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision. The 2-to-1 decision from a three-judge panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers. Those rules, created by the Federal Communications Commission in early 2015, started a huge legal battle as cable, telecom and wireless internet providers sued to overturn regulations that they said went far beyond the F.C.C.\'s authority and would hurt their businesses. On the other side, millions of consumers and giant tech firms rallied in favor of the regulations. President Obama also called for the strictest possible mandates on broadband providers. The court\'s decision upheld the F.C.C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has broad-reaching implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online. "After a decade of debate and legal battles, today\'s ruling affirms the commission\'s ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protections -- both on fixed and mobile networks -- that will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future," Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement. The two judges who ruled in favor of the F.C.C. emphasized the importance of the internet as an essential communications and information platform for consumers. "Over the past two decades, this content has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from profound actions like choosing a leader, building a career, and falling in love to more quotidian ones like hailing a cab and watching a movie," wrote David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan, the judges who wrote the opinion. But the legal battle over the regulations is most likely far from over. The cable and telecom industries have signaled their intent to challenge any unfavorable decision, possibly taking the case to the Supreme Court. AT&T immediately said it would continue to fight. "We have always expected this issue to be decided by the Supreme Court and we look forward to participating in that appeal," said David McAtee II, the senior executive vice president and general counsel for AT&T. For now, the decision limits the ability of broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon to shape the experience of internet users. Without net neutrality rules, the broadband providers could be inclined to deliver certain content on the web at slower speeds, for example, making the streams on Netflix or YouTube buffer or shut down. Such business decisions by broadband providers would have created fast and slow lanes on the internet, subjecting businesses and consumers to extra charges and limited access to content online, the F.C.C. has argued.

Credit Matthew Eisman/Getty Images for Common Sense Media The 184-page ruling also opens a path for new limits on broadband providers beyond net neutrality. Already, the F.C.C. has proposed privacy rules for broadband providers, curbing the ability of companies like Verizon and AT&T to collect and share data about broadband subscribers. Google and Netflix support net neutrality rules and have warned government officials that without regulatory limits, broadband providers will have an incentive to create business models that could harm consumers. They argue that broadband providers could degrade the quality of downloads and streams of online services to extract tolls from web companies or to promote unfairly their own competing services or the content of partners. The court\'s ruling was a certainty for the F.C.C. Two of the three judges who heard the case late last year agreed that wireless broadband services were also common carrier utility services that were subject to anti-blocking and discrimination rules, a decision protested by wireless carriers including AT&T and Verizon Wireless. In the opinion, the two judges in favor of the rules said internet users don\'t feel the difference between fixed-wire broadband and mobile service. To an iPad user, whose device switches automatically between Wi-Fi and wireless networks, the government\'s oversight of those technologies should not differ, they said. Tech firms cheered the decision, which they said would be particularly helpful to start-ups that did not have the resources to fight gatekeepers of the web. "Today marks a huge victory for the millions of microbusinesses who depend on the open internet to reach consumers and compete in the global marketplace," said Althea Erickson, the senior director of global policy at the online crafts marketplace Etsy. In a statement, the cable industry\'s biggest lobbying group highlighted the comments of the dissenting judge, Stephen Williams, and said that its members were reviewing the opinion. The group also said broadband legislation by Congress was a better alternative to the F.C.C.\'s classification of internet business as a utility. "While this is unlikely the last step in this decade-long debate over internet regulation, we urge bipartisan leaders in Congress to renew their efforts to craft meaningful legislation that can end ongoing uncertainty, promote network investment and protect consumers," the National Cable and Telecommunications Association said in a statement. In his lengthy dissenting opinion, Mr. Williams called the rules an "unreasoned patchwork" that will discourage competition in the broadband industry. The biggest threat to broadband providers is the potential of any regulations to hurt the rates they charge for the service, analysts said. The F.C.C. has promised it will not impose rate regulations on the firms like it does for phone companies. "The pendulum has today swung a bit further in the direction of long-term price regulation," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson. The F.C.C. was divided along party lines on the rules. It began its quest for net neutrality rules in 2009, with two previous attempts at creating rules overturned by the same court. In a statement, Ajit Pai, a Republican commissioner who was among a minority who opposed the regulation of broadband as a utility, urged cable and telecom firms to keep going with their legal challenge. "I continue to believe that these regulations are unlawful, and I hope that the parties challenging them will continue the legal fight," he said.

S'This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. DENVER -- It sounds too good to be true: what if someone paid you to leave your car at the airport, while you\'re on vacation? You would actually make money, instead of paying to park. A new company just opened for business at Denver International Airport, promising to make all of that possible. But there is one catch: you have to be willing to go into the rental car business. Flightcar will rent out your car to a stranger, while you\'re out of town. "Basically you drop your car off airport with us, and we take you to the airport and you park for free the entire time you\'re gone, and while you\'re gone, somebody can then rent your car at a discounted rate and we cover the insurance up to a million dollars on that vehicle, and the person who allowed their car to be rented makes a percentage of revenue from the rental itself," said Ryan Adlesh, Head of Expansion for Flightcar. It\'s a peer-to-peer rental car company - sort of like VRBO or AIRBNB - websites that allow you to rent your house to strangers. In this case it\'s your vehicle, that would just be sitting there at the airport, costing you money anyway. Tyler Moore tried Flightcar for the first time last month in Los Angeles, and loved it. He said it\'s way different than your normal rental car experience. "It was definitely a little weird. In a way it was kind of cool though, because it kind of felt like a friend was loaning you their car, and you weren\'t in a sterilized 2015 Camry or something," he said. Right now, Flightcar is operating out of the lobby of the Cambria Suites Hotel near DIA. A clerk handles all the details there, taking your car and then allowing another traveler to use it, just like it was Hertz or Avis. "Worst case scenario, if someone doesn\'t rent your car, you receive free airport parking the entire time, (and a ) washed, cleaned, vacuumed car when you come back," Adlesh said. Flightcar actually has celebrity backing - both Ashton Kutcher and Ryan Seacrest are investors. To learn how to rent out your car, go to Flightcar\'s website here . 39.856096 -104.673738 AlertMe'

S'Home Depot has signed an agreement with 3D printer company MakerBot to sell its line of Replicator machines. The consumer-grade, desktop MakerBot Replicator 3D printers will initially be part of a pilot program in 12 stores located in California, Illinois and New York.

MakerBot said both its printers and 3D scanning technology will be showcased in specific demo areas in the Home Depot stores and that trained MakerBot retail staff will be on hand to provide information about the products. MakerBot\'s scanners allow solid objects to be transposed into a 3D computer-aided design image that can then be used to print out an object. Customers will also be offered free 3D-printed items to take home with them, including adjustable wrenches, electrical outlet covers and drink cups. The Home Depot is not the first retailer to add 3D printers to its list of products. A MakerBot Replicator 3D printer creates an outlet cover (Image: MakerBot). Retailers such as Staples and service providers like UPS are testing in-store services to give their customers a chance to use the technology without having to buy the hardware and related materials. Driven by consumer machines such as MakerBot\'s, the sale of 3D printers and related materials is expected to balloon from $75 million this year to $1.2 billion by 2018, according to a report published in June. Along with MakerBot, the surge in 3D printers is expected to be spurred by the entry of mainstream 2D printer companies such as HP and Epson into the 3D fray.

The entry of conventional printer companies into the market, along with the development of a strong ecosystem of software, apps and materials, is expected to convince consumers to start buying 3D printers. "In order for 3D printing to successfully find a mainstream market amongst consumers, it needs to widen the applications available that integrate consumer lifestyle and drive a number of applications beyond professional printing," Nitin Bhas, an analyst with Juniper Research, said.

S'New model falls short of five-star benchmark with rugged construction holding crash performance back. The all-new 2019 Jeep Wrangler has been given a stinging one-star safety rating in the latest round of assessments from independent body, Euro NCAP . The fourth-generation JL Wrangler , revealed earlier this year, was already out of the running for a five-star rating due to its lack of autonomous emergency braking at launch. The single-star result revealed by Euro NCAP today comes as a massive blow to the new model before it goes on sale, making it the lowest-rated car as tested under 2018 criteria, which not only analyses crash data for occupant protection, but evaluates accident avoidance tech and pedestrian impact performance. According to crash data from Euro NCAP, the new Wrangler\'s low adult occupant (50 per cent) and vulnerable road user (49 per cent) protection led to the result. The lack of technologies like AEB and curtain airbags make for a very low 32 per cent assist systems score. Jeep was quick to address the Wrangler\'s low test result, with the company releasing a statement defending the Wrangler\'s crash assessment, citing the specialist nature of the vehicle to justify the rating, as follows: "The new Jeep Wrangler - an award-winning vehicle with unmatched capability and worldwide appeal - meets or exceeds federal safety requirements in every market in which it is sold. "Further, the Jeep Wrangler is engineered to deliver superior performance and unique driving experiences under the most demanding conditions. Testing protocols that apply exclusively to urban scenarios may not align with such a vehicle. "Notwithstanding such misalignment, the new Jeep Wrangler benefits from fully boxed, body-on-frame construction featuring pressure-formed front-rail sections, with high-strength steel in all critical areas. The vehicle offers more than 70 advanced safety and security features, including four standard-equipment air bags and, starting in early 2019, an advanced Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system that combines the benefits of camera and radar technologies." One of the critical areas of assessment, the lack of AEB, is set to improve as part of a running change to the Wrangler overseas. Australia-bound Wranglers will include the collision avoidance technology as standard from launch. Other tech from Euro NCAP\'s safety assist criteria not available on the Wrangler includes lane assist and an active bonnet. In the official Euro NCAP assessment structural issues were identified: "The connection between the A-pillar and the trans-facia beam was damaged in a way that indicated the structure would be unable to withstand higher loads. Similarly, deformation of the footwell showed that the structure had reached the limit of its integrity." according to the technical data from the report. A spokesperson for Jeep Australia detailed the standard safety spec expected across the range in Australia, which includes the as-yet untested AEB system not included in the Euro NCAP test. "The Jeep Wrangler arrives in Australia with a long list of standard and available safety equipment, including front and side airbags, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-path detection, parking sensors, a rear-view camera and autonomous emergency braking, all of which is paired with the use of high-strength steel in its construction designed to protect the cabin in the case of an accident," the spokesperson explained. "Safety is something we take incredibly seriously, and every other member of our Jeep family of vehicles wears a five-star safety rating with pride, whether they have been crash-tested by ANCAP in Australia or by Euro NCAP. The Wrangler is a specialist vehicle that offers unique features that are highly valued by our customers, both in Australia and overseas. "The Wrangler is a motoring icon. It\'s a specialist off-road performance vehicle. Part of what makes it such an icon, is the fact that its doors, roof and windscreen can be removed or folded down. Such unique features have formed an important part of its 77-year history, which have made the Wrangler such a long-standing symbol of off-road freedom." 2018 has so far proven a tough year for specialist 4x4 vehicles in the Euro NCAP spotlight, with the new Suzuki Jimny recording a three star result earlier this year. Adult occupant and pedestrian protection dragged down the Jimny\'s result, as did its AEB performance in certain conditions. Local crash test authority ANCAP confirmed that the European result may not be indicative of the rating applied to local cars, but that the European result was disappointing. Any modifications to the vehicle, be they structural or related to specifications, could result in independent testing in Australia. A spokesperson for ANCAP indicated that at this stage it was too early to know if that would be the case for the Wrangler. Australian deliveries of the 2019 Jeep Wrangler are expected to begin towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. It\'s unknown at this stage if the Euro NCAP findings will have an impact on Australian launch timing. MORE: Jeep Wrangler news, reviews, comparisons and videos MORE: Everything Jeep'

S'TOKYO -- Suzuki Motor , Mazda Motor and Yamaha Motor conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles in Japan, Nikkei learned Wednesday. This is the latest in a growing list of compliance scandals in the country\'s auto industry, and was confirmed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport on Thursday. The three companies submitted reports on the findings to the ministry in response to a request for all domestic automakers to investigate compliance procedures after Nissan Motor and Subaru were found to have falsified testing data earlier this year. The suspect tests were performed on samples of manufactured vehicles selected during the quality assurance process. Samples were found to have been tested under incorrect driving conditions. Suzuki unearthed improper tests on 6,401 units out of 12,819 since 2012. Mazda detected inappropriate testing on 72 vehicles out of 1,875 since 2014, while Yamaha found seven instances out of 335 since 2016. Suzuki President Toshihiro Suzuki apologized for his company\'s actions at a news conference on Thursday afternoon. "It is a significant fact that such a large number of our products were improperly processed, and we take it seriously," he said. "We failed to educate our staff in an in-depth and extensive manner." The automaker is not considering product recall at this moment, he added. This is the first time Mazda has been implicated in a quality compliance scandal since the first in a series of such cases emerged at Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki in 2016. At a news conference later on Thursday, Kiyotaka Shobuda, Mazda\'s senior managing executive officer, told reporters that there were no deliberate alterations to the data, and that the improper inspections did not affect the quality of the cars. "The company takes the incident seriously, and will make sure to prevent the improper inspections from happening again," Shobuda said. The transport ministry will change its ministerial ordinance to request automakers save test results of manufactured vehicles and take measures to prevent alteration of results. "It is extremely regrettable that this situation makes users anxious over the quality of vehicles and the quality control operations of carmakers," said Transport Minister Keiichi Ishii. The stock prices of all three companies began falling on Thursday morning. At one point, Suzuki and Yamaha stocks had fallen by over 5% from Wednesday. "Stock prices suffered at carmakers where cheating was found. The stocks of Yamaha were also on a downward trend," said one analyst. Masataka Kunugimoto, managing director at Nomura Securities, said the impact on business performance would be "very minor if any." "It seems that foreign customers do not mind these incidents as they do not really affect the performance of the car itself," he said, citing similar previous cases. Subaru submitted a report in April that it said detailed the extent of its falsifying of fuel economy and emissions data, as well as testing cars under conditions not recommended by the government. But the company was forced to admit in June that the problem affected roughly double the number of sample vehicles. Nissan owned up to its own fuel and emission cheating last month. Additionally, both Subaru and Nissan used unqualified inspectors to perform final vehicle checks. There is no indication that Toyota Motor, Honda Motor or Daihatsu Motor have carried out improper final vehicle inspections. However, the new revelations mean that four of the eight passenger carmakers in Japan have been exposed for the practice. When the first of the scandals surfaced in 2016, Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor were found to have conducted fuel economy tests during the vehicle development phase in a manner that did not comply with domestic regulations. Improper final vehicle inspections, such as those uncovered this week, are "not something intended to deceive the consumer," said Takaki Nakanishi, CEO of the Nakanishi Research Institute. In the eyes of consumers, however, the reputation of Japan\'s auto industry has been undermined. Experts say that it is imperative for automakers to ensure compliance with industry regulations and put in place systems to prevent recurrence if they are to repair the damage to their brands.

S'Image copyright Reuters Image caption The scene on Thursday in Nantes, as school students protested against education reforms The French government says it fears "major violence" in Paris on Saturday as the national "yellow vests" protest movement shows little sign of easing. The Eiffel Tower is to close along with many shops, restaurants and museums and thousands more police will be on duty. The government said it was scrapping the fuel tax increases in its budget - the original spark for the protests. But broader discontent with the government has spread, and protests have erupted over several other issues. On Thursday young people took to the streets, protesting over educational reforms. More than 140 people were arrested when a protest outside a school in Mantes-la-Jolie in Yvelines ended in clashes with police. Dozens of other schools were blockaded in cities including Marseille, Nantes and Paris. Students have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron\'s plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality. Meanwhile, Saturday\'s planned rally of the yellow vests looks set to go ahead. Recent protests have turned violent, causing millions of euros in damage. Image caption Students at Saint-Exupery high school in Mantes-la-Jolie were detained by police How has the government responded? Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said that "exceptional means" would be used on Saturday. He said 89,000 police officers would be on duty across France and armoured vehicles would be deployed in the capital - the first time since 1968. Confirming that the fuel tax had been abandoned, he told senators that the calm of most protesters around the country contrasted with the "extreme violence" seen in Paris. "Unlike others, I\'m not seeking to apportion blame for this anger," he said. As mayor of the northern port of Le Havre he said he had felt local anger rise every year, after every election. "It\'s been muted for a long time, because it\'s been silenced for a long time, by shame, sometimes by pride." What is the government worried about? The protest on Saturday 1 December descended into the worst rioting seen in decades, with hundreds of injuries and arrests. The government says extremists hijacked the protests and incited violence. French health minister Agnes Buzyn, speaking to RTL Radio on Thursday morning, said: "There is a concern about this violence, and some who do not want to find a solution." The government is considering mobilising the military to protect important national monuments, French broadcaster BFMTV reported, after the world-famous Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week. Police advised stores and restaurants on the Champs-Elysees to shut for the day. A series of football matches have also been postponed. They include those between Paris and Montpellier, Monaco and Nice, Toulouse and Lyon, and Saint-Etienne and Marseille. How are the protests spreading? The yellow vests protests have moved beyond the initial anger over fuel taxes. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government. Among them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age. The government has already acknowledged some of the concerns, suggesting it may review the "wealth tax" it abolished after taking power. An analysis of its original budget plans for 2018-2019 showed it benefitted the very wealthy rather than the very poor. Other groups, bolstered by the success of the national movement, have also begun separate actions. One police union, Vigi, called for a strike of its administrative staff working in the interior ministry for Saturday - saying that without the support of such staff, riot police would be immobilised. Two road transport unions, the CGT and FO, have called for a strike among its 700,000 members on Sunday, Le Monde reported. Drivers have been affected by changes to overtime payments, the unions say, which affect the purchasing power of its members.

S"Image copyright AP The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) says electronic devices such as mobile phones can be left switched on during flights. EASA says that electronic devices do not pose a safety risk. The announcement clears the way for airlines to permit the use of mobile phones, once they have conducted their own safety reviews. Currently airline passengers have to switch devices to flight mode and make calls from the airport terminal. The EASA sets the framework for airlines making safety decisions. The agency said each airline would still have to go through an assessment process, ensuring aircraft systems are not affected by the signals from portable electronic devices before establishing their own rules for their operation. As a result there could be a delay in implementing the new rules at some airlines. It also says that airlines may opt for different policies on the use of mobile devices. Analysis: Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent This move strips away the last regulatory hurdle stopping airline passengers in Europe from making phone calls or using wi-fi on any flight, even while taxiing. But that doesn't mean you'll have to endure the bloke next to you babbling on about his work for an hour during your next flight. First of all, you can't get a signal at 33,000 feet. Not yet anyway. Secondly, the airlines will need to pay to kit out their planes so that phones and wi-fi work. And thirdly, there's the passengers. British Airways, for example, already has a business-class-only flight from London to New York that lets passengers use wi-fi and send texts. But they block voice-calls, because whenever they survey passengers, most baulk at the idea of everyone around them talking on the phone during a flight. Airliners remain one of the last places work can't get hold of you on the phone."

S'Image copyright Getty Images Emails written by Facebook\'s chief and his deputies show the firm struck secret deals to give some developers special access to user data while refusing others, according to MPs. A cache of internal documents has been published online by a parliamentary committee. It said the files also showed Facebook had deliberately made it "as hard as possible" for users to be aware of privacy changes to its Android app. Facebook had objected to their release. It said that the documents had been presented in a "very misleading manner" and required additional context. The emails were obtained from the chief of Six4Three - a software firm that is suing the tech giant - and were disclosed by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as part of its inquiry into fake news. About 250 pages have been published, some of which are marked "highly confidential". Damian Collins MP, the chair of the committee, highlighted several "key issues" in an introductory note. He wrote that: Facebook allowed some companies to maintain "full access" to users\' friends data even after announcing changes to its platform in 2014/2015 to limit what developers\' could see. "It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted," Mr Collins wrote Facebook had been aware that an update to its Android app that let it collect records of users\' calls and texts would be controversial. "To mitigate any bad PR, Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features," Mr Collins wrote Facebook used data provided by the Israeli analytics firm Onavo to determine which other mobile apps were being downloaded and used by the public. It then used this knowledge to decide which apps to acquire or otherwise treat as a threat there was evidence that Facebook\'s refusal to share data with some apps caused them to fail there had been much discussion of the financial value of providing access to friends\' data Facebook said Six4Three had "cherry-picked" the documents and claimed they had omitted "important context". "We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends\' data with developers," said a spokeswoman. "Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. "But the facts are clear: we\'ve never sold people\'s data." Mr Zuckerberg has also posted a personal response on his Facebook page . "I understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems. That\'s healthy given the vast number of people who use our services around the world, and it is right that we are constantly asked to explain what we do," he said. "But it\'s also important that the coverage of what we do - including the explanation of these internal documents - doesn\'t misrepresent our actions or motives." Tactics revealed The correspondence includes emails between Facebook and several other tech firms, in which the social network appears to agree to add third-party apps to a "whitelist" of those given permission to access data about users\' friends. This might be used, for example, to allow an app\'s users to continue seeing which of their Facebook friends were using the same service. Image caption Netflix tapped into Facebook friends lists to let users see what titles their contacts had watched and rated highly They include: the dating service Badoo, its spin-off Hot or Not, and Bumble - another dating app that it had invested in the car pick-up service Lyft the video-streaming service Netflix the home rental service Airbnb However, others including the ticket sales service Ticketmaster, Twitter\'s short-video platform Vine and the connected-cars specialist Airbiquity seem to have been denied the privilege. Among the emails that have been published are the following extracts: Blocking Vine The following concerns a decision to prevent Twitter\'s short-form video service having access to users\' friends lists. It is dated 24 January 2012. Justin Osofsky (Facebook vice president): "Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video... Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. We\'ve prepared reactive PR, and I will let Jana know our decision." Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook chief executive): "Yup, go for it." Android update The following is part of a discussion about giving Facebook\'s Android app permission to read users\' call logs. It is dated 4 February 2015. Michael LeBeau (Facebook product manager): "As you know all the growth team is planning on shipping a permissions update on Android at the end of this month.

S'Image copyright Reuters Image caption The men made the gesture outside the Reichstag building in Berlin Two Chinese tourists were arrested in Berlin for making Hitler salutes outside the German parliament on Saturday. Criminal proceedings have been started against the middle-aged men for using symbols from a banned organisation. The pair have been released on bail of EUR500 (PS450; $600) each. Germany has strict laws on hate speech and symbols linked to Hitler and the Nazis. The men - aged 36 and 49 - could face a fine or a prison sentence of up to three years, according to police. The same charges are most commonly used to prosecute members of the far right. A police spokeswoman told AFP news agency that the men could leave the country during the investigation and that if a fine is handed down, the bail money they had already paid would probably cover it. The visitors were seen taking pictures of each other with their mobile phones outside the Reichstag building, which houses the German parliament.'

S'A Nova Scotia woman says a rental car company has charged her $47,000 after the vehicle she rented was stolen from the company lot after it had been returned. Kristen Cockerill says she rented a Ford Mustang from a Dartmouth, N.S., Enterprise Rent-A-Car for two days in early October. She says that when her partner returned the car on a Sunday evening, the location was closed, so he put the keys in a secure drop box situated on the Enterprise property, as the contract instructed her to do so. Cockerill says the next day she got a call from the company informing her that while employees had found the keys in the drop box, the car was not on the lot. Cockerill says she found out later that day that the company had reported the as car as stolen to police. And then this past Monday, nearly four months after she rented the sports car, Cockerill received a letter from Enterprise informing her that she was on the hook for the cost of the stolen Mustang. "It came as a really big shock," she told CTVNews.ca. "I was never told that we might be held accountable for this." Cockerill says the company informed her that the car was technically in her possession when it was stolen, and that the company only regains possession of the car when it is able to inspect it. Enterprise confirmed the company\'s policy in a statement emailed to CTVNews.ca on Friday. "Please keep in mind that a sign prominently displayed on the key drop-box reminds customers that the vehicle remains their responsibility until it can be checked in by an employee," said the statement from Enterprise spokesperson Laura Bryant. "Customers are financially responsible for any damage or theft that occurs during a rental transaction, regardless of fault or negligence - just as if they owned the rental vehicle themselves." The company says that it is continuing to review the case and it "is our intention to work with the customer and her (Cockerill\'s) insurance company to achieve a fair and reasonable outcome." Cockerill says that her partner, who dropped off the car to the Enterprise location that Sunday evening, likely didn\'t see the sign. And while Cockerill says that she has also seen the sign in recent media reports about her issue with the company, she says she believes many customers might not take notice of it since it is often dark when they are returning vehicles. "People have already made the decision, as was in their contract, to drop off the car at that point," she added. Cockerill said Enterprise has not contacted her since she received the bill on Monday. She says when she rented the car she did not purchase an Enterprise insurance package because she was already covered by another provider. She says that provider plans on investigating. Cockerill, however, says that she is worried about financial strain if the issue is forced to go to court. "If there is some small print in the contract that says that customers are liable until it (the vehicle) is received by the company the next business day, then I think rental car companies need to make customers aware of that very clearly from the beginning so we can make an informed decision," she said, adding that she got rid of her contract after she believed the matter had been put to rest. Cockerill says if she had known she was still liable for the car when it was returned that Sunday night, she would have considered keeping it for another day, even if she would have been charged. She says she also would have considered purchasing an Enterprise insurance package if it covered the car while it sat in the lot before an employee could inspect it. "This is the first time I have ever rented a car to be quite honest," she said. "But what I\'m hearing from people is the same shock: \'Oh my god I had no idea that that\'s the case.\' It\'s not a nice way to start the New Year."'

S'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The stolen encryption keys allowed agencies to decode data that passes between mobile phones and cell towers US and British intelligence agencies hacked into a major manufacturer of Sim cards in order to steal codes that facilitate eavesdropping on mobiles, a US news website says. The Intercept says the revelations came from US intelligence contractor turned whistleblower Edward Snowden. The Dutch company allegedly targeted - Gemalto - says it is taking the allegations "very seriously". It operates in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing facilities. The Intercept says that "the great Sim heist" gave US and British surveillance agencies "the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world\'s cellular communications, including both voice and data". It says that among the clients of the Netherlands-based company are AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and "some 450 wireless network providers around the world". Full investigation The Intercept alleges that the hack organised by Britain\'s GCHQ and the US National Security Agency (NSA) began in 2010, and was organised by operatives in the "Mobile Handset Exploitation Team". Neither agency has commented directly on the allegations. However GCHQ reiterated that all its activities were "carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate". Image caption Experts say that the alleged hack is a major compromise of worldwide mobile phone security How does the hack work? Each Sim card has an individual encryption key, installed by the chip manufacturer, that secures communications between the handset in which it inserted and mobile phone masts. This means that if anyone were to snoop on conversations or text messages, they would receive garbled, unintelligible data. That is, of course, unless those carrying out the surveillance get hold of the encryption key. With that information, they can even decrypt previously intercepted communications. However, this tactic only works for phone conversations and text messages. Communications through mobile applications such as Whatsapp, iMessage and many email services have separate encryption systems. The stolen encryption allowed the agencies to decode data that passes between mobile phones and cell towers. They were able to decrypt calls, texts or emails intercepted out of the air. A Gemalto spokeswoman said the company was unable to verify whether there had indeed been a breach, and highlighted that other Sim manufacturers could also have been targeted. She added: "We take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate and understand the scope of such highly sophisticated techniques to try to obtain Sim card data". Global ripples Reacting to The Intercept\'s revelations, Eric King, deputy director of the campaign group Privacy International, said the NSA and GCHQ had "lost sight of what the rule of law means and how to weigh what is necessary and proportionate". He said trust in the security of our communications systems is "essential for our society and for businesses to operate with confidence". And the impact of these latest revelations will have "ripples all over the world." Image caption Gemalto also manufactures ID chips for passports, among other technologies Privacy International is currently engaged in legal action against GCHQ over its alleged hacking practices. Gemalto makes Sim cards for mobile phones and furnishes service providers with encryption codes to keep the data on each phone private. The Intercept claims that by first cyber-stalking employees at Gemalto and then penetrating their emails, the spy agencies were able to steal thousands of encryption keys at source. This would allow them to eavesdrop easily on phone calls and texts without seeking permission from telecoms companies or foreign governments, and without leaving a trace. The Intercept cites as its source documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who is currently living in Russia. \'Weakest link\' Karsten Nohl, a security researcher who has exposed previous Sim card vulnerabilities, told the BBC the leak showed that "it is still not terribly difficult" to circumvent encryptions on mobile phone communications. He added that since it was Gemalto, and not the mobile providers, which sets Sim encryption codes, this makes the Dutch firm the "weakest link of the security chain". Other Gemalto clients, such as passport agencies, buy blank chips and set the codes themselves. "A lot of telecom companies will be scrambling to find out what went wrong," said Mr Nohl. Analysis: Joe Miller, BBC technology reporter Image copyright Thinkstock If The Intercept\'s report is to be believed, the most striking discovery is how easily those wanting to engage in mass surveillance can eavesdrop on our mobile communications. Gemalto, the company which was allegedly targeted, manufactures an estimated 30% of all Sim cards worldwide. And crucially, it creates the security key for each item. All security agencies needed to do was obtain (by hacking, allegedly) the list of security keys from the firm. Then, as security expert Karsten Nohl says, they could snoop on phone calls with a "few hundred dollars worth of radio equipment in strategically important locations". This contrasts with security procedures used, for example, for chips in passports. Many are also manufactured by Gemalto. These are delivered to the relevant authorities as a blank chip, and the Passport Office - not the company - creates the security key. Many of Edward Snowden\'s allegations have shone a light on complex surveillance tactics by the NSA. But perhaps this latest leak has done more to highlight how a single company is in control of millions of people\'s private data.'
